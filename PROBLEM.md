Programming Test: Battle ships

The purpose of this test is primarily to examine your problem-solving skills, it will not be analysed using automated tools.
Anyone can write code a computer can understand. You should write you code so that it can evolve and be change easily. With separation of concerns. Think about possible future requirements.

You must a Vue.JS application. Comment your code as you see fit. Write the test coverage you feel is necessary.

The Problem:
Implement a game of battle ships. If you’ve never played the game, you can get a feel for it from this online game.
You should create an application to allow a single human player to play a one-sided game of battleships against the computer.
The program should create a 10x10 grid, and place a number of ships on the grid at random with the following sizes:

- 1x Battleship (5 squares)
- 2x Destroyers (4 squares)

The application should accept input from the user in the format “A5” to signify a square to target, and feedback to the user whether the shot was success and additionally report on the sinking of any vessels. The grid should be visually represented on screen. While we dont expect you to create a rich graphic user interface the UI should look clean and easy for humans to understand. Please share your submission as a public github repo on your own github profile. Share how long you spent on the assignment.
